This list contains features that needs to be done.
Please, keep it in actual state.

General:
* Detail objects (static, but not in BSP)
* Built-in triangle models (embedded into BSP tree)
* Alpha-test
* More consistent file errors handling
* Avoid usage of "unwrap"

Engine:
* More advanced skeleton animation - with animations combination, override matrices for specific bones, ragdoll, etc.
* Anmation files as separate resources (share animations between different models).

Renderer:
* 3/4 and 1/4 rasterization blending
* Optimizations/fixes of triangle models rasterization
* Rasterization microoptimizations
* HDR skyboxes
* Animated textures (with N frames)
* Models rendering improvements - avoid splitting models into pieces for each BSP tree leaf in some cases
* Models clipping optimizations
* Avoid applying dynamic lights to all surfaces - apply only needed lights
* Dynamic lights with 2D shadowmap (not only cube)
* Dynamic lights without shadows
* Emissive textures (lamps, screens)
* Billboards and sprites
* Decals

Lightmapper:
* Colored shadows
* Shadows from dynamic objects (configurable)

Map compiler:
* Speed-up of large maps compilation
* More map source formats (Quake II, Quake III Arena), Source Engine
