This list contains features that needs to be done.
Please, keep it in actual state.

General:
* Detail objects (static, but not in BSP)
* Built-in triangle models (embedded into BSP tree)
* Alpha-test
* Arbitrary dynamic models rotation (Euler angles?)
* More models formats
* More consistent file errors handling
* Avoid usage of "unwrap"

Engine:
* Screen surface update parallel with other operations (game logic, rendering preparation)
* Skeleton-based animation
* Smooth animation for frame-based animated models (interpolate between 2 or more frames)

Renderer:
* Fix buggy splitting of submodels polygons when polygon lies in clip plane
* Skyboxes
* 3/4 and 1/4 rasterization blending
* Triangle models lighting
* Rasterization microoptimizations
* Animated textures (with N frames)
* Models rendering improvements - avoid splitting models into pieces for each BSP tree leaf in some cases
* Models clipping optimizations
* Avoid applying dynamic lights to all surfaces - apply only needed lights
* Dynamic lights with 2D shadowmap (not only cube)
* Dynamic lights without shadows
* Emissive textures (lamps, screens)
* Billboards and sprites
* Decals

Lightmapper:
* Polygons without shadows
* Light volumes (for dynamic objects lighting)
* Semitransparent objects shadows
* Shadows from dynamic objects (configurable)

Map compiler:
* Speed-up of large maps compilation
* More map source formats (Quake II, Quake III Arena), Source Engine
