This list contains features that needs to be done.
Please, keep it in actual state.

General:
* Detail objects (static, but not in BSP)
* Built-in triangle models (embedded into BSP tree)
* More consistent file errors handling
* Avoid usage of "unwrap"

Engine:
* More advanced skeleton animation - with animations combination, override matrices for specific bones, ragdoll, etc.
* Animation files as separate resources (share animations between different models).
* Basic sound support - with game-driven sound playback and sound resources
* Avoid memory allocations in same places.
* Store resources (maps, textures, models, etc.) in archive file(s)

Renderer:
* Fix buggy visibility calculationg with portals clipped by "z_near" plane
* Multiplicative blending
* Models rendering improvements - avoid splitting models into pieces for each BSP tree leaf in some cases
* Shadows from triangle models
* Multithreaded shadowmaps building
* Animated simple textures (with color only), that are used for models, sprites, decals
* Water texture - add possibility to generate emissive layer
* Water texture - add mode with diffuse texture modulation by wave field
* Fire texture - add possibility to produce diffuse texture (not only emissive layer)
* Unreal-style animated ice textrures (with one layer, refracted via another layer)
* Mix normals and roughness in layered texture animations
* Support portals and mirrors with mixed texture, prepared as regular surface (with lightmaps, normal-mapping, dynamic lights, etc.)
* Sky room - draw view from specified map location after drawing skybox

Lightmapper:
* Colored shadows
* Shadows from dynamic objects (configurable)
* Emissive light from dynamic objects (configurable)
* Alpha-shadows (with texture fetch in tracing code)
* Shadow tracing speed-up

Map compiler:
* Speed-up of large maps compilation
* Improve portals clipping/discarding - build helper leafs on all polygons, perform full clipping of portal by all leaf polygons lying on portal plane
* More map source formats (Quake II, Quake III Arena), Source Engine
* Bezier curves support (perform tesselation during map compilation)

Test game:
* Load proper map while loading game
* Materials with collision filters (pass bulletes, but not player, etc.)
